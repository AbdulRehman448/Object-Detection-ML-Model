# 🚦 YOLO Object Detection Machine Learning Model Project  

## 📌 Overview  
The YOLO Object Detection project demonstrates a complete end-to-end workflow for detecting objects in **images, videos, and real-time streams** using **YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once)**.  

The project starts with **pre-trained models**, progresses to **training a custom mini-model on the COCO dataset**, and finally deploys an **interactive Streamlit app** for user-friendly interaction.  

This project is implemented in **Python** and integrates **YOLOv8, OpenCV, and Streamlit** for building, training, evaluating, and deploying the object detection system.  



## 🚀 Features  
- **Day 1:** Image detection using pre-trained YOLOv8 models  
- **Day 2:** Object detection in uploaded videos  
- **Day 3:** Real-time detection via webcam and multiple image inputs  
- **Day 4:** Training a mini YOLOv8 model on a subset of the COCO dataset  
- **Day 5:** Deployment of YOLO with a modern Streamlit web app  
- Support for **custom .pt weights**, adjustable confidence thresholds, and output visualization  



## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Python 3.x**  
- **YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)** → Object detection model  
- **OpenCV** → Image and video processing  
- **NumPy, Pandas** → Data handling and annotations  
- **Matplotlib / PIL** → Visualization  
- **Streamlit** → Interactive web-based deployment  
- **Pyngrok** → Public sharing of Streamlit apps  



## 📊 Example Workflow  
1. Load pre-trained YOLOv8 model  
2. Run detection on images/videos/webcam  
3. Train YOLOv8 on COCO128 mini dataset  
4. Export trained weights (`.pt`)  
5. Deploy an interactive Streamlit app for end users  



## 🔮 Future Improvements  
- Enhance UI with **multi-page navigation** in Streamlit  
- Add support for **live video streaming** (IP cameras, RTSP feeds)  
- Train on **custom datasets** for domain-specific detection  
- Deploy on **cloud platforms** (AWS, GCP, Heroku) or as a **Dockerized service**
